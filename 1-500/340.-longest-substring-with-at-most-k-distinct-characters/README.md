# 340. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters



Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return _the length of the longest substring of_ `s` _that contains at most_ `k` _**distinct** characters_.

&#x20;

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The substring is "ece" with length 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring is "aa" with length 2.
```

&#x20;

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `0 <= k <= 50`
