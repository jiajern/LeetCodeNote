# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops" %}

### Description

There are `n` cities connected by some number of flights. You are given an array `flights` where `flights[i] = [fromi, toi, pricei]` indicates that there is a flight from city `fromi` to city `toi` with cost `pricei`.

You are also given three integers `src`, `dst`, and `k`, return _**the cheapest price** from_ `src` _to_ `dst` _with at most_ `k` _stops._ If there is no such route, return __ `-1`.

### Example



**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation: The graph is shown.
The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as marked red in the picture.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation: The graph is shown.
The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as marked blue in the picture.
```

### Constraints

* `1 <= n <= 100`
* `0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
* `flights[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= fromi, toi < n`
* `fromi != toi`
* `1 <= pricei <= 10^4`
* There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
* `0 <= src, dst, k < n`
* `src != dst`
